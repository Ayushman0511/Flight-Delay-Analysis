# 🛫 Flights Data Analysis & Modeling

This project summarizes the **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data modeling** performed on a flights dataset containing domestic flight details from **2015**.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`flights.csv`** → Dataset containing domestic flight records
* **`analysis.ipynb`** → Jupyter Notebook with detailed EDA and modeling steps
* **`report.pdf`** → Final report summarizing insights, assumptions, and conclusions
* **`supporting.py`** → Python script supporting the report and notebook analysis

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to explore the flights dataset, perform **data cleaning, visualization, and modeling**, and derive meaningful insights about domestic air travel patterns. The notebook demonstrates the workflow, while the report presents a clear summary of findings and conclusions.

## ⚡ Key Highlights

* 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding flight delays, cancellations, and trends
* 🛠️ **Data Modeling:** Applying machine learning models for delay prediction
* 📈 **Visualization:** Charts and plots for clear interpretation of flight behavior
* 📝 **Report:** Insightful summary with assumptions and actionable conclusions

## 💻 Tech Stack & Skills

* **Python** (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
* **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Machine Learning Modeling**
* **Report Writing** with insights and conclusions
